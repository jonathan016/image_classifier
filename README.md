# image_classifier
Simple Image Classifier using modified Tensorflow code for Computer Vision course.

This program was created for educational purposes only. We try to implement algorithms and use tools as defined in https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining, and thus all codes in scripts folder are property of Tensorflow.

We modified a script for our application purposes, which is label_image.py file. The output, which should have been the probability of each class for input image, into one class label with probability value equal to or over 0.6 to ensure that the label is the most probable for the input image.
